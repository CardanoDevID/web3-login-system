# My first Try Using Mesh.js (Cardano Web3 Library)

This is my first test to try and learn the Cardano Web3 Mesh.js library. The purpose of this test is to find and check whether there is a wallet that has an NFT token called primetest1.

Here is a reference link to the Mesh.js documentation that I studied: https://meshjs.dev/guides/nextjs

The code I made is a modification of the reference above. To see how it works, let's watch the following video documentation.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
